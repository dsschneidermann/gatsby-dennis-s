## **DETAILED COMPETENCIES**

## :coffee: Intro

<div class="cvIntro">
<div>

Architect and SW specialist with 5 years of experience developing for Azure and cloud platforms, with a focus on IoT, Web Services in back-end Enterprise IT, Security and DevOps.

</div>
<div>

For the last 3 years I have worked *exclusively* with IoT projects, both on the Edge and cloud, which means that I have extensive experience with IoT architectures and related Big Data and Streaming architectures.

As a consultant, I aim to keep a broad base of knowledge that's updated with the latest in software quality, agile methods, security patterns, Cloud Native, Microservices, data science and analytics, and DevOps and CI/CD. From earlier projects, I also have experience with front-end development.
